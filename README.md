That makes you human — and this a machine.

## About Me
I am a doctoral researcher working at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Biomedical Signal Processing, and Medical Imaging**.  
My research focuses on building **intelligent systems that can understand, transform, and transfer knowledge from human physiological data** across different sensing modalities and computational constraints.

While **rPPG is a core part of my PhD work**, my research extends to multiple domains, including:

- Medical image analysis (MRI, ultrasound, video, physiological imaging)
- Biosignal processing (EEG, PPG, PSG, multi-modal signals)
- Knowledge transfer from high-capacity models to low-resource systems
- Machine intelligence for real-world healthcare deployment
- Signal-aware and quality-aware learning systems

I design **end-to-end AI pipelines** — from raw signals and images to robust, deployable intelligence.
